# Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT)
The FRVT API repository is currently being updated.  Updated API header files are available,
and an updated validation package will be pushed in the upcoming weeks.

# Cloning the repository
We recommend developers clone the entire repository and run validation from within
the folder that corresponds to the evaluation of interest.  The ./common directory
contains files that are shared across all validation packages.
