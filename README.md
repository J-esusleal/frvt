# Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) Quality Vector Updates
This branch contains draft updates to the [FRVT Quality](https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_quality.html) API.    

# API updates
A new vectorQuality() function has been proposed to evaluate algorithms capable of detecting specific defects in images (such as non-frontal head orientation).

Draft versions of the Quality API document version 2.0 and Quality Concept document will be available for comment soon.  Please direct any questions or comments to frvt@nist.gov.

# Cloning the repository
We recommend developers clone the entire repository and run validation from within
the folder that corresponds to the evaluation of interest.  The ./common directory
contains files that are shared across all validation packages.
